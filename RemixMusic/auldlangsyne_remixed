should times acquaintance be forgot 
and never brought to mind 
should times acquaintance be forgot 
and days of times long past 
for times long past my dear 
for times long past 
we'll take a cup o kindness yet 
for days of times long past 
we twa hae run about the braes 
and pu'd the gowans fine 
but we've wander'd mony a weary fit 
sin days of times long past 
we twa hae paidl'd i the burn 
frae morning sun till dine 
but seas between us braid hae roar'd 
sin days of times long past 
for times long past my dear 
for times long past 
we'll take a cup o kindness yet 
for days of times long past 
and surely ye'll be your pint-stowp 
and surely i'll be mine 
and we'll take a cup o kindness yet 
for times long past 
and there's a hand my trusty fiere 
and gie's a hand o thine 
and we'll take a right gude-willy waught 
for times long past 
for times long past my dear 
for times long past 
we'll take a cup o kindness yet 
for times long past 
for times long past my dear 
for times long past 
we'll take a cup o kindness yet 
for times long past
